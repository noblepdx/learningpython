I started ["100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023"](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) with Dr. Angela Yu.  
This is just to document my Python lessons and for point of reference in my learning process.   
Excited to finally be picking up a language. It is long overdue.
